# Customer-Segmentation
In this project, you will analyze a dataset containing data on various customers' annual spending amounts (reported in monetary units) of diverse product categories for internal structure. One goal of this project is to best describe the variation in the different types of customers that a wholesale distributor interacts with. Doing so would equip the distributor with insight into how to best structure their delivery service to meet the needs of each customer.

The dataset for this project can be found on the UCI Machine Learning Repository. For the purposes of this project, the features 'Channel' and 'Region' will be excluded in the analysis â€” with focus instead on the six product categories recorded for customers.

Description of Categories

# FRESH: annual spending (m.u.) on fresh products (Continuous)
# MILK: annual spending (m.u.) on milk products (Continuous)
# GROCERY: annual spending (m.u.) on grocery products (Continuous)
# FROZEN: annual spending (m.u.)on frozen products (Continuous)
# DETERGENTS_PAPER: annual spending (m.u.) on detergents and paper products (Continuous)
# DELICATESSEN: annual spending (m.u.) on and delicatessen products (Continuous)
